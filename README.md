1.  **Clone the Project:**
    Place the project folder into your Web Server's root directory (e.g., `c:\xampp\htdocs\eBooks-library`).

2.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Open phpMyAdmin or your MySQL management tool.
    *   Run the script `database/schema.sql` to create the `library_db` database, tables, and seed data.

3.  **Application Configuration:**
    *   Open the file `config/config.php`.
    *   Check and modify the connection details if necessary:
        ```php
        define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
        define('DB_USER', 'root');
        define('DB_PASS', ''); // Your MySQL password
        define('DB_NAME', 'library_db');
        ```
    *   Ensure `URL_ROOT` points to the correct path on your browser (e.g., `/eBooks-library/public`).

4.  **Run the Application:**
